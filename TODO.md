### General
- Generate anki deck / notes from japanese text in separate file
	- Have a file selection function
- Be able to update existing decks with new cards? 
	- OR better to generate new deck per chunk (e.g. 1 deck for 1 set of song lyrics, or 1 deck per paragraph from large text?
	should ideally be quite customisable)
	- Are people going to want to paste a whole book in here? (doesn't seem wise to allow too large text)
- Put setup instructions into README
	- Make sure setup instructions are comprehensive
- Error catching!
- Optional Auto-Furigana
	- Get furigana from MeCab
	- Incorporate to anki decks (test python-generated anki decks for furigana (how does Anki do it?))

### GUI
- Create GUI in PyQt (kivy has IME input issues) OR Tkinter
	- Paste text directly
	- Select file containing text

### Licensing
